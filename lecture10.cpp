//Functions in Cpp
//Function overloading-->many functions can be there with the same name(polymorphism feature)
//Inline Function--> can be converted into a line which reduces the function overhead
//Default arguments-->
//if function has four parameters but only one argument is passed then other values will be 0
//Default arguments are always from the left..can't appear from the middle
