//rand()-->generates a random function
//first write srand(time(NULL))
//and then use rand() else it will generate same values
//if rand() can have the maximum value as two digit then write it as rand()%100
//if rand() has to generate the numbers in the given range then write 
//range = high-low+1 and rand()%range+low
